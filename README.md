# Narrative

## Motivation

The average human walks approximately 110,000 miles over their lifetime. Most of that time, however, is spent in solitude or silence. What if we could harness that time? What if we could make your walk more entertaining and exciting all while improving you as a person in the process? 

## About

Narrative aims to tackle this question. The app draws from users' location, current events, and other data in order to curate a collection of audio to play to you while you walk. Users are able to select their preferred news and content sources in order to provide a more personal experience. The UI is simple: just a play button. Users should be walking - the app will do all the hard work of finding content for them.
